## 1. Project Overview

Precision agriculture demands data-driven decision support systems that can guide farmers in selecting the most suitable crop for a given parcel of land. This project implements a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for **automated crop recommendation**, leveraging soil macro-nutrient measurements and local climatic parameters as predictive features.

The pipeline addresses the following research objectives:

- To preprocess and normalise multi-variate agro-climatic data in a manner that prevents data leakage across train, validation, and test partitions.
- To systematically engineer domain-informed features — including nutrient ratios, climate interaction indices, pH-nutrient coupling terms, and polynomial expansions — that improve the discriminative capacity of baseline features.
- To compare the predictive performance of three classical supervised classifiers — **Random Forest**, **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)**, and **Decision Tree** — under rigorous hyperparameter optimisation via stratified cross-validation.
- To produce interpretable evaluation artefacts, including confusion matrices, per-class F1 heatmaps, ROC curves, and feature importance rankings.

| **Total Samples** | 2,200 |
| **Classes** | 22 crop types (100 samples per class — perfectly balanced) |
| **Class Balance** | Stratified; no oversampling required |
| **Missing Values** | None |

### Input Features

| Feature | Unit | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `N` | kg/ha | Ratio of Nitrogen content in soil |
| `P` | kg/ha | Ratio of Phosphorus content in soil |
| `K` | kg/ha | Ratio of Potassium content in soil |
| `temperature` | °C | Mean ambient temperature |

### Target Variable

| Variable | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|

> **Note on Outliers:** IQR-based outlier analysis is performed during preprocessing for diagnostic purposes. No records are removed, as agronomically extreme values — such as elevated nitrogen for rice cultivation — are domain-valid observations that encode meaningful signal.

---

## 3. System Architecture

The pipeline is composed of three sequential, modular scripts. Each module reads from the output of its predecessor and writes artefacts to the shared `artifacts/` directory.

## 4. Module Descriptions

### 4.1 Data Preprocessing

**Script:** `preprocessing.py`

This module establishes a clean, leak-free data foundation for all downstream modelling steps.

**Key operations:**

**Label Encoding** — The categorical target variable (`label`) is transformed into integer class indices using `sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder`. The fitted encoder is persisted alongside the data to ensure consistent inverse mapping at inference time.

**Stratified Train/Validation/Test Split** — The dataset is partitioned in a 70/15/15 ratio using two sequential `train_test_split` calls with `stratify=y_encoded`. Stratification preserves the original class distribution (100 samples per class) across all three partitions, guarding against evaluation bias.

**Feature Scaling** — A `StandardScaler` is fit exclusively on the training partition and subsequently applied to the validation and test partitions via `transform` (not `fit_transform`). This design strictly prevents data leakage, as statistics from held-out data must never influence the scaling parameters used during training.

**Output:** `artifacts/preprocessed_data.pkl` containing scaled feature arrays, encoded target arrays, the fitted scaler, and the label encoder.

---

### 4.2 Feature Engineering

**Script:** `feature_engineering.py`

This module enriches the original seven-feature space with 22 additional domain-informed and statistically motivated features, expanding the total feature dimensionality before pruning redundant variables.

#### 4.2.1 Domain-Driven Ratio Features

Nutrient ratios are widely used in agronomy to characterise soil fertility balance:

| Feature | Formula | Agronomic Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `N_P_ratio` | N / (P + ε) | Nitrogen–Phosphorus balance |
| `N_K_ratio` | N / (K + ε) | Nitrogen–Potassium balance |
| `P_K_ratio` | P / (K + ε) | Phosphorus–Potassium balance |
| `NPK_sum` | N + P + K | Total macro-nutrient load |
| `NPK_product` | N × P × K | Nutrient synergy interaction term |

#### 4.2.2 Climate Interaction Features

These composite indices capture non-additive relationships between temperature, humidity, and precipitation:

| Feature | Formula | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| `temp_humidity_index` | temp × humidity / 100 | Wet-bulb / heat-stress proxy |
| `rainfall_humidity` | rainfall × humidity / 100 | Water availability index |
| `temp_rainfall_ratio` | temp / (rainfall + ε) | Aridity indicator |

#### 4.2.3 pH–Nutrient Interaction Features

Nutrient availability in soil is highly pH-dependent due to solubility dynamics. Interaction terms between pH and each macro-nutrient (`ph_N_interaction`, `ph_P_interaction`, `ph_K_interaction`) encode these coupled effects.

#### 4.2.4 Polynomial Features

Second-degree polynomial expansions of key agronomic variables (`temperature`, `rainfall`, `ph`, `humidity`) allow the model to capture non-linear response curves — for instance, the optimal rainfall range for a given crop.

#### 4.2.5 Log Transforms

Right-skewed features — including `NPK_product`, `rainfall`, and individual macro-nutrients — are log-transformed via `log1p` to reduce skewness and improve numerical stability during optimisation.

#### 4.2.6 Feature Selection via Correlation Pruning

A Random Forest classifier is trained on the expanded feature set to compute Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI) importance scores. Features with pairwise absolute Pearson correlation exceeding **|r| > 0.97** are considered redundant; the lower-ranked member of each correlated pair is dropped. This process retains the most informative non-redundant feature subset for model training.

**Output:** `artifacts/feature_engineered_data.pkl`, `artifacts/feature_importance_report.csv`, and three visualisation files.

---

### 4.3 Model Training & Evaluation

**Script:** `model_training.py`

This module performs systematic hyperparameter optimisation and comparative evaluation of three candidate classifiers.

#### Hyperparameter Optimisation

`GridSearchCV` with 5-fold stratified cross-validation is applied to the combined train+validation data (`X_tv`, `y_tv`). The scoring criterion is **accuracy**. Search spaces are defined as follows:

**Random Forest**
```
n_estimators      : [100, 200]
max_depth         : [None, 20, 30]
min_samples_split : [2, 5]
max_features      : ['sqrt', 'log2']
```

**K-Nearest Neighbours**
```
n_neighbors : [3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
weights     : ['uniform', 'distance']
metric      : ['euclidean', 'manhattan']
```

**Decision Tree**
```
max_depth         : [5, 10, 15, 20, None]
min_samples_split : [2, 5, 10]
criterion         : ['gini', 'entropy']
```

The best estimator from each grid search is subsequently evaluated on the held-out test set.

## 5. Machine Learning Models

### Random Forest Classifier

An ensemble of decision trees trained via bagging. Each tree is fit on a bootstrap sample of the training data, and predictions are aggregated by majority vote. The model is robust to overfitting and naturally provides feature importance estimates via MDI. It is well-suited to high-dimensional tabular data with complex feature interactions.

### K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)

A non-parametric, instance-based classifier that assigns class labels by plurality vote among the *k* nearest training examples in feature space. KNN is sensitive to feature scale, making prior standardisation essential. Its performance depends heavily on the choice of *k*, distance metric, and weighting scheme.

### Decision Tree Classifier

A recursive binary partitioning model that selects splits to minimise impurity (Gini or entropy) at each node. Decision trees are interpretable and scale-invariant, but are prone to overfitting without adequate depth constraints. `max_depth` and `min_samples_split` regularisation are applied during grid search.

---

## 6. Evaluation Metrics

All three models are evaluated on the held-out **test set** using the following metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Test Accuracy** | Proportion of correctly classified samples |
| **F1-Score (Macro)** | Unweighted mean F1 across all 22 classes |
| **F1-Score (Weighted)** | Class-frequency-weighted mean F1 |
| **ROC-AUC (OvR, Macro)** | One-vs-Rest multi-class AUC averaged across classes |
| **5-Fold CV Accuracy** | Mean ± std of cross-validated accuracy on train+val data |

---
